    My professional journey in technology began as a software testing engineer, where my natural curiosity 
and drive to understand how things work led me to explore the inner workings of software systems and the 
value of quality in building great products. This role gave me valuable insight into how different 
components of an application interact and function together.
    
     As I gained deeper experience in testing, my fascination with the architecture and development of software systems grew. This growing interest inspired me to pursue software development by enrolling in LaunchCode’s software development course. Through this hands-on, project-based program, I sharpened my programming skills, expanded my technical knowledge, and prepared for a transition into a development role.
     
     Today, I’m focused on building scalable, efficient solutions and continuously learning new technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating with others, and contributing to meaningful, user-centered projects. I’m excited to connect with fellow professionals, work on innovative solutions, and grow within the vibrant tech community.
