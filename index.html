            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My professional journey in technology began as a software testing engineer, where my natural curiosity and drive to understand how things work led me to explore the inner workings of software systems and the importance of quality in building great products. This role provided valuable insight into how different components of an application interact and function together.</p>  
            <p>Over time, my fascination with software architecture and development deepened, motivating me to pursue a path in software engineering. This growing interest inspired me to pursue software development by enrolling in LaunchCode’s software development course. During the program, I sharpened my skills in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript </li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Spring Boot</li>
                <li>MySQL</li>
            </ul>     
    
            <p>Today, I’m focused on building scalable, efficient solutions and continuously learning new technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating with others, and contributing to meaningful, user-centered projects. I’m excited to connect with fellow professionals, work on innovative solutions, and grow within the vibrant tech community.</p>

    <h3>Easy Pharma Finder - Launchcode Capstone Project</h3> 
    <p>This application is designed to help insured users navigate the complex world of prescription medication costs. With healthcare plans constantly changing and insurance companies frequently shifting medication providers, it can be difficult for patients and caregivers to understand the true cost of their prescriptions.
    Easy Pharma Finder aims to support users by providing clear, transparent, and personalized pricing information for their medications. By simply entering their ZIP code, users can easily compare the real cost of prescriptions at local pharmacies. The application lists their actual cost, deductible status, and insurance copay—all in one easy to read view.</p>
